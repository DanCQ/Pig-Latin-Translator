A website to convert words into Pig Latin. <br>
I'm using regular expressions to match the words.

Pig Latin is a way of altering English Words. The rules are as follows:

- If a word begins with a consonant, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word, and add ay to it.

- If a word begins with a vowel, just add way at the end.
